##  :beginner: About
This is a minimal yet functional to-do list application built with Flutter that allows users to easily add and delete tasks. The to-do items are persisted locally so progress is saved across app sessions.

## :zap: Dependencies Used
This project makes use of the following key dependencies:
- [hive 2.2.3](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) - For local data persistence and caching
- [hive_flutter 1.1.0](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_flutter) - Integration of Hive with Flutter to access locally stored data
- [flutter_slidable 3.0.0](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slidable) - Provides slidable widgets for the task list rows
- [hive_generator 2.0.1](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_generator) -  Generates necessary code for Hive
- [build_runner 2.3.3](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner/versions/2.3.3) - Tool to generate Hive code from hive_generator

The project contains reusable code to quickly build a To-Do list app with Flutter. It can serve as a starting point for implementing local data storage and retrieval in a Flutter mobile app.
